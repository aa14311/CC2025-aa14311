# Week 1 notes
### :books: *Reading: Douglas Rushkoff, Program or Be Programmed (Introduction)*

**:space_invader: Quote 1:**

> Before, failing meant surrendering our agency to a new elite. In a digital age, failure could mean relinquishing our nascent collective agency to the machines themselves. (page 14)

This quote made me think of power imbalances and how machines will play into this. The gap between rich and poor is wide and this made me think how machines could make this worse or better.

**:book: Quote 2:**

> The Torah was not merely a by- product of text, but a code of ethics for dealing with the highly abstracted, text-based society that was to characterize the next two millennia. (page 16)

I think about the establishments and rules created for society. The relevance of rules set in previous times for current environments.

**:thought_balloon: Quote 3:**

> The industrial age challenged us to rethink the limits of the human body: Where does my body end and the tool begin? The digital age challenges us to rethink the limits of the human mind: What are the boundaries of my cognition? (page 16)

This is already being adopted in my everyday life. I played an MMORPG that "required" the use of AI to efficently play the game. This could be to figure out calculations and optimal strategies.
